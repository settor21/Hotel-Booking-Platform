# Hotel Booking Platform
This application allows users to make bookings for hotel rooms. 
The hotelier can adjust the price rate and level of  room service, occupancy as well as the types of rooms available. The client then chooses the duration of stay and the price is calculated. 
The rate control application was developed using Avalonia UI with the MVVM architecture to allow for new rates and sections to the form model to be updated if necessary. 
The customer dashboad and the form were developed using Blazor.
